Työhyvinvointiboosteri is a final publication for a joint applied research project by Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. It sums up the results of two work life quality related projects into one practical handbook for enterpreneurs and small businesses. Challenge for the publication was, how to visualize and tell the results of an abstract topic in compelling way.

Together with graphical and UI designer from [Muotografia](https://muotografia.fi/), we started with concepting the site with client. During the concepting workshops we chose to divide the publication in three parts: visual stories of four example companies, easy to access and read handbook, and a section with in-depth articles.

Besides concepting, my role on the project was to plan and develope the custom Wordpress theme. Theme utilises components from Bootstrap. I also did the photography for visual stories section.
