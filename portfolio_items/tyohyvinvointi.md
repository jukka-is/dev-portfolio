Työhyvinvointiboosteri is a final publication for a joint applied research project by Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. It sums up the results of two work-life-quality related projects into one practical handbook for entrepreneurs and small businesses. Challenge for the publication was, how to visualize and tell the results of an abstract topic compellingly.

Together with the graphical and UI designer from [Muotografia](https://muotografia.fi/), we started with concept-building workshops with the client. During this process, we chose to divide the publication into three parts: visual stories of four example companies, the easy-to-access-and-read handbook, and a section with in-depth articles.

Besides concept building, my role in the project was to plan and develop the custom WordPress theme. The theme utilizes components from Bootstrap. I also did the photography for the visual stories section.
