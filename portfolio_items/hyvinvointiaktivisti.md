The final publication project was a joint effort with me and [Muotografia](https://muotografia.fi/). Together we facilitated a concept building workshop with the client to find out the best form and structure for the site to present vast content or articles that the results of the three-year research project.

Muotografia designed the visual identity and UI for the site. I planned the technical implementation and developed a custom WordPress theme, utilizing some components from Bootstrap. To accommodate the structure of publication, with 6 main categories and 3 repeating thematic topics, data structure was made with help of custom post types and Advanced Custom Fields plugin.

Special attention was paid to the accessibility of the site as the client is regulated by standards for the public sector in this regard. The site had to meet the standards of WCAG 2.1 AA-level. This was taken into account in all steps of the project from graphical design to technical implementation. At the end of the project, accessibility criteria were tested and verified with the client's accessibility specialist.
