Final publication project was a joint effort with me and [Muotografia](https://muotografia.fi/). Together we facilitated concepting workshop with client to find out best form and structure for the site to present vast content or articles that the results of three-year research project.

Muotografia designed the visual identity and UI for the site. I planned the technical implementation and developed a custom Wordpress theme, utilising some components from Bootstrap. In order to accommodate the structure of publication, with 6 main categories and 3 repeating thematic topics, data structure was made with help of custom post types and Advanced Custom Fields plugin.

Special attention was paid for the accessability of the site as client is regulated by standards for public sector in this regard. Site had to meet standards of WCAG 2.1 AA-level. This was taken in account in all steps of design and development from graphical design to technical implementation. At the end of the project, accessability criterias were tested and verified with client's accessability specialist.
