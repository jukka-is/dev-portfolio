My role in the project started with concepting visual image and functional layout for the site and continued with technical implementation as well as conducting product photography.

Client's desire was to build a very minimalistic site with high quality photography to match brands represented in the shop. This was the starting point for the UI design as well.

Site was built on Wordpress / WooCommerce platform with a custom theme built utilising some components from Bootstrap 5. SASS-based workflow helped compiling style libraries from WooCommerce and Bootstrap together. Dependency on external plugins was kept at minimal level, with some exceptions, like Advanced Custom Fields.

To match the clean and minimalistic feel of the site, I decided to build some features from scratch. An example of this is the image gallery feature for viewing product images. This was built with plain javascript.
