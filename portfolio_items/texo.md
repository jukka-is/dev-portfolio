The website is an information portal for The Finnish Association of Textile Artists TEXO. The site's main function is to communicate association's message towards its members as well as the general public and media.

My role in the website project was technical implementation: creating the concept and developing a WordPress child theme with needed functionalities. As one of the custom features, the association's member list was integrated into the site through REST API from a third-party service. The client's wish was to keep the site's content easily updatable, so we chose to use site builder (Divi) for templating the pages.

The site's visual identity and UI design were made by [Muotografia](https://muotografia.fi/).
