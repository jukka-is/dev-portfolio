Website is information portal for The Finnish Association of Textile Artists TEXO. Site's main function is to communicate associations message towards its members as well as general public and media.

My role in website project was technical implementation: concepting and building wordpress child-theme with needed functionalities. As one of the custom features, association's member list was integrated to the site through REST API from a third party service. Client's wish was to keep site's content easily updatable, so we chose to use site builder (Divi) for templating the pages.

Site's visual identity and UI design was made by [Muotografia](https://muotografia.fi/).
