Midori Tsunoi is an illustrator and textile designer based in Helsinki, Finland. Her works are inspired by Finnish nature. The starting point for her new portfolio site was to reflect this: natural, simple, and clean aesthetics.

My role in the project was to concept the structure, create UI designs, and develop a WordPress theme for the site. To keep the content easily customizable for the client, the site was built with a page builder tool (Divi) and implemented as a child theme.
