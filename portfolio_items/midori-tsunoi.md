Midori Tsunoi is an illustrtor and textile designer based in Helsinki, Finland. Her works are inspired by Finnish nature. Starting point for her new portfolio site was to reflect this: natural, simple and clean aesthethics.

My role in the project was to concept the structure, create UI designs and develope Wordpress theme for the site. In order to keep the content easily customisable for the client, site was built with page builder (Divi) and implemented as a child theme.
