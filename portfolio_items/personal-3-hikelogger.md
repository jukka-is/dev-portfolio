### Simple Class Based Shipping est at lobortis

Simple Class Based Shipping (SCBS) is WooCommerce shipping method that enables custom shipping option for products in chosen shipping class.

As an example, web shop owner might have several shipping methods depending on what sized products are ordered. There could be need for smaller shipping fee for items that can fit inside envelope. This shipping option should be available only when client's shopping cart include items that meet this criteria.

SCBS is supporting WooCommerce Shipping zones and instances of it can be defined for different zones and/or for different shipping classes.
