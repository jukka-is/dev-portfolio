Simple Class Based Shipping (SCBS) is a Wordpress plugin which extends WooCommerce shipping methods. It enables custom shipping option for products in chosen shipping class.

I came accross need for simple and low-maintanance solution for custom shipping method that would allow web shop owner to have flexibility to offer different shipping options based on the items size (though shipping class). As a common example, shop owner might want to provide smaller shipping fee for items that can fit inside envelope. This shipping option should be available only when client's shopping cart include items that meet this criteria.

SCBS is supporting WooCommerce Shipping zones and instances of it can be defined for different zones and/or for different shipping classes. Plugin is licensed under GPL v2 and it's repository is public in my [Github](https://github.com/aaxxiiss/simple-class-based-shipping-WC)
