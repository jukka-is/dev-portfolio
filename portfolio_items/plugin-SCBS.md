Simple Class Based Shipping (SCBS) is a Wordpress plugin that extends WooCommerce shipping methods. It enables a custom shipping option for products in chosen shipping class.

I came across the need for a simple and low-maintenance solution for a custom shipping method that would allow webshop owners to have the flexibility to offer different shipping options based on the item's size (though shipping class). As a common example, a shop owner might want to provide a smaller shipping fee for items that can fit inside an envelope. This shipping option should be available only when the client's shopping cart includes items that meet this criterion.

SCBS is supporting WooCommerce Shipping zones and instances of it can be defined for different zones and/or for different shipping classes. The plugin is licensed under GPL v2 and its repository is public in my [Github](https://github.com/jukka-is/simple-class-based-shipping-WC).
