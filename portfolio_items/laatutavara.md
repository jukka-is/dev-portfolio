Laatutavara.com has been operating in the market Scandinavian vintage design items since 2006. With it's large database of products and general information, it has became go-to place for design enthusiasts. Site's original infrasctructure started to get out of date and client wished to move it to Wordpress / WooCommerce platform. Main driver's for the change was need for better content management tools, extended integrations (e.g. payment and shipping services), better user experience especially in mobile - and all in all, refreshed visual identity where the stunning and unique products truly stand out.

My role in project was concepting the new site, technical implementation of the database migration and developing the custom wordpress theme and it's UI. Visual identity was designed by [Muotografia](https://muotografia.fi/).

Site's vast amount of information posed many challenges. Special attention needed to be paid for the browsing and filtering functions of the catalogue as well as the search tool. For search, Relevanssi plugin was utilized to customise the search results. Site feature's two language versions, which were implemented with WPML.
