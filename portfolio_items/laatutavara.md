Laatutavara.com has been operating in the market of Scandinavian vintage design since 2006. With its large database of products and general information, it has become the go-to place for design enthusiasts. The site's original infrastructure started to be out of date and the client wished to move it to WordPress / WooCommerce platform. The main drivers for the change were the need for better content management tools, extended integrations (e.g. payment and shipping services), better user experience especially in mobile - and all in all refreshed visual identity where the stunning and unique products truly stand out.

My role in the project was to create the concept for the new site, plan and conduct the database migration, and develop the custom WordPress theme and its UI. The visual identity was designed by [Muotografia](https://muotografia.fi/).

The site's vast amount of information posed many challenges. Special attention needed to be paid to the browsing and filtering functions of the catalog as well as the search tool. For search, the Relevanssi plugin was utilized to customize the search results. The site features two language versions, which were implemented with the WPML plugin suite.
