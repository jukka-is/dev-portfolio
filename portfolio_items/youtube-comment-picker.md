Youtube comment picker is a web application for randomly picking a winner among comments on a Youtube video. The user inputs a video ID and the application fetches comments related to the video through Youtube API. User has an option to narrow down the list of comments by filtering results by keyword, allowing only one comment per user, or excluding the video creator's comments. After set-up, the user can pick randomly one or more comments from the list.

This application was my personal project to learn more about interacting with Google's APIs, especially Youtube API. That's why I decided to keep the application as simple as possible and not to include any external frameworks. Application is made with client-side javascript, HTML, and CSS. Application's source code is available in my [Github](https://github.com/jukka-is/youtube-comment-picker).
