Youtube comment picker is a web application for randomly picking a winner among comments on a Youtube video. User inputs video ID and application fetches comments related to the video through Youtube API. User has an option to narrow down comments list by filtering results by keyword, allow only one comment per user or to exclude video creator's own comments. Then user can pick randomly one or more comments from the list.

This application was my personal project to learn more about interacting with Google's APIs, especially Youtube API. That's why I decided to keep application as simple as possible and not to include any external frameworks. Application is made with client side javascript, html and css. Application's source code is available in my [Github](https://github.com/aaxxiiss/youtube-comment-picker)
