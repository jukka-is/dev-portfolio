Metropolia University of Applied Sciences' project "Tarinallisuus ja tarinateatteri" researched methods of utilizing narration, storytelling, and drama in pedagogic work. Results of a years-long project needed to be packaged in a single-page publication that would have similar playful aesthetics as the research topic itself. The publication site had to meet WCAG 2.1 criteria for accessibility as the project was publicly funded.

Web-publication's visual identity and UI were designed by [Muotografia](https://muotografia.fi/). My role in the project was to concept and develop a custom WordPress theme for the site, paying special attention to accessibility all the way. WordPress theme is utilizing Bootstrap components, SCSS-build-process, and Advanced Custom Fields.
