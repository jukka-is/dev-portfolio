Metropolia University of Applied Sciences' project 'Tarinallisuus ja tarinateatteri' researched methods of utilising narration, story telling and drama in pedagogic work. Results of years-long project needed to be packaged in single-page publication that would have similar playful aesthethics as the research topic itself. Publication site had to meet WCAG 2.1 criterias for accessability, as project was publicly funded.

Web-publication's visual identity and UI was desgined by [Muotografia](https://muotografia.fi/). My role in the project was to concept and develope custom Wordpress theme for the site, paying special attention for accessability all the way. Wordpress theme is utilising Bootstrap components, SASS build-process and Advanced Custom Fields.
