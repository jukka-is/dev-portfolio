If you wondered, how this portfolio site was made, you can find the project's repository at [Github](https://github.com/jukka-is/dev-portfolio).

TLDR: Site is built on Next.js platform, content being markdown-files, React components built for this project only. Development, graphical, and UI design by yours truly; hosted by Vercel.
