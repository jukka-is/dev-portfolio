The website compiles the insights produced during Augmented Urbans, a three-year collaborative research project in extended reality (XR) technologies. The goal for the publication was to create a simple and distraction-free user experience for reading the articles.

My role in the project was to plan and develop the technical implementation of the publication based on the visuals designed by the client's graphical designer. The publication was built on a Wordpress platform with a custom theme covering the core functionalities needed. The theme utilizes Bootstrap components. The site included also custom javascript components, such as portfolio grid, that were created for this site. Special attention was paid to the accessibility of the site as the client is regulated by standards for the public sector in this regard.
