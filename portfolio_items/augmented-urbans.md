The website compiles the insights produced during Augmented Urbans, a three-year collaborative research project in extended reality (XR) technologies. The goal for the publication was to create simple and distraction-free user-experience for reading the articles.

My role in the project was to plan and develope then technical implementation of the publication based on the visuals designed by client's graphical designer. Publication was built on Wordpress platform with a custom theme covering the core functionalities needed. Theme utilizes Bootstrap components. Site included also custom jaavscript components, such as portfolio grid, that were created for this site.
